# A Python Tkinter YouTube Downloader

I always wanted to build a Python GUI app, having a nice User Interface and then I found out about `tkinter` and `pytube`. `tkinter` is a python library used to bulid simple GUI apps with python, and `pytube` is a python library for getting all kind of info and stuff for any YouTube video(most importantly downloading YouTube videos).
So I built a python GUI app to download YouTube videos on my local computer, which is basically a **YouTube Downloader**.

## Working & Functionalities:
- On giving the URL of the YouTube video, it fetches all available resolutions of that video with their sizes in MBs, and lists out the options to download on the Command Prompt.
- It also keeps track of the progress of download by showing percentage downloaded on the cmd window.
